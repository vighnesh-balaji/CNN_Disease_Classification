# CNN_Disease_Classification
Help farmers identify diseases in potato plants by looking at their leaves

- Blight can be a deadly disease for plants and cause major cause of losses for framers
- I built a CNN model to identify blight on leaves to find early on.
- I trained my model to identify both early and late-stage blight by keeping them as separate classes.
- The architecture of model is standard CNN layers followed by max pool layers
- I deployed the model using FastAPI too, to be usable by farmers
